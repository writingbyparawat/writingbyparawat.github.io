    <p><a class="button" href="pdf/ENGLISH%20381%20-%20Sample%201%20(Word%20Manual%20Chapter%202).pdf">Microsoft Word 2016 Manual</a><br>
        This is a 9-page sample from my Microsoft Word manual, "Microsoft Word 2016 for Poets," written for my <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/english380/home">Technical Writing class</a>. This chapter specifically focuses on the basics of Word 2016, such as aligning margins and inserting page numbers.</p>

        This is a short, 1-page monologue poem (from the point of view of Marie Antoinette) written for a Creative Writing seminar. I intend this to be read aloud due to its sonic qualities.</p>

        This is a 5-page ethnographic report written for my Anthropology class. The contents of the paper are developed from research, interviews, and field notes.</p>

        This is a short, 1.5-page sample from a longer novella I wrote for my Creative Writing seminar. The novella itself discusses the breaking of gender norms and explores the feelings of love and motherhood.</p>
