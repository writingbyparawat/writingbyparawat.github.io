    <h2>National Honor Society (Quincy High School Chapter) website</h2>
        <p>The QHS (my high school) Chapter of NHS completes a variety of fundraisers and donates to a different cause every year. We celebrate academic excellence and work together to grow as a community. I also believe that making a site for the National Honor Society would look well on my resume.</p>
    
    <p>Possible tabs include:</p>
    
        <ul>
        <li>Fundraising</li>

    <h2>Mama Bear website</h2>
        <p>Mama Bear is a local pizzeria that is just down the street from where I live in Quincy. They have a website but it houses many broken links and seems to generally have been abandoned. I think the website would work well, but the issue is collecting images due to Amherst being a few hours away.</p>
    
    <p>Possible tabs include:</p>
    
        <ul>
        <li>Menu</li>
        <li>Contact Us</li>
        <li>Order Online</li>

    <h2>Glazed (Amherst) website</h2>
        <p>Glazed benefits from both its close vicinity and my love for donuts. While they do currently have a working website, I believe that creating another more aesthetically pleasing one would be a fun but challenging assignment.</p>
    
    <p>Possible tabs include:</p>
    
        <ul>
        <li>Menu</li>
        <li>Contact Us</li>
        <li>Order Online</li>
        <li>Donut Gallery</li>
        </ul>
