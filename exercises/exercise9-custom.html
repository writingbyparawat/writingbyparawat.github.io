<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Parawat and I'm currently a junior enrolled at UMass Amherst. I am a BDIC (International and Technical Writing)/English double major, with Anthropology and Japanese minors.</p>

<p>When not in school, I enjoy creative writing, reading, watching Netflix and other TV shows, and listening to music. My tentative goal out of college is to be hired as a technical writer, but I am open to working with whatever other opportunities life can offer me.</p>

    <p>Paragraph 1: Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.</p>
